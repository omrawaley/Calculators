# Calculators
A bunch of calculatorsâ€”surface area, volume, hypotenuse, etc.

Java and Python versions available in the `Java` and `Python` folders.

# For Java

`.jar` files are available in the `out > artifacts > _jar` folder.

Be sure to run `java -jar "path-to-.jar"` in your command line!

# For Python

Might be a bit slower lol.

Be sure to run `python "path-to-.py` in your command line!

Note: You may have to use either `python` or `python3` depending on your installed version of Python.
